"""
Given two arrays A and B (n-element and m-element) with elements that are natural numbers. The arrays are in ascending order.
Construct an algorithm to determine the number of elements belonging to AUB (sum of sets, ie. each element can occur once).
E.g. A = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8}, B = {1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}, AUB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10}, so the number you are looking for is 8.
